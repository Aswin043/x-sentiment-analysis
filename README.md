## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on tweets using classical machine learning models and NLP preprocessing techniques. It includes:

- Data preprocessing (cleaning tweets, tokenization, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF or Bag-of-Words)
- Training and evaluation of classifiers (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
- Model performance visualization and interpretation

## 🧰 Features

- 📊 Multi-class sentiment classification (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
- 🧹 Full preprocessing pipeline (handles hashtags, mentions, URLs, emojis)
- 📈 Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- 💬 Real-time sentiment prediction on custom input
